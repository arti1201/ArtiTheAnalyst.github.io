								<h4>Project Overview</h4>
								<p><b>Designed and developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to monitor and analyze company-wide sales performance across 
									different product categories, customer segments, and geographical regions, empowering stakeholders to make informed, 
									data-driven decisions.</p></b>
									<hr />
                                <h4> What I Built</h4>
								<p><b>Sales Performance Dashboard</b>
									<ol><b>
									<li>Visualized key metrics such as Total Sales (2.3M) and Total Orders (5K) using KPI cards for quick insights.</li>
									<li>Created slicers for Year and Category to enable users to dynamically filter and explore data.</li>
									<li>Developed a Top Products Table showcasing the highest-selling products with their corresponding revenue.</li>
									<li>Built a Sales by Segment donut chart highlighting sales distribution among Consumer, Corporate, and Home Office segments.</li>
									<li>Designed a Sales by Category bar chart for easy comparison among Technology, Furniture, and Office Supplies.</li>
									<li>Illustrated Sales Trends Over Years using a line chart to display year-on-year growth.</li>
									<li>Integrated a Sales by Region map to visualize regional sales distribution across North America, Europe, and other global regions.</li>
								</b>
								</ol></p>
								<hr />
								<h4> How I Built It</h4>
								<p><ol><b>
									<li>Data Preparation: Imported the Excel dataset into Power BI, verified data types, corrected any missing values, and ensured consistency 
										across fields like Order Date, Sales, Region, Segment, and Category.</li>
								    <li>Exploratory Analysis: Conducted an initial analysis to identify the most relevant KPIs and trends, focusing on revenue growth, segment 
										performance, and product profitability.</li>
									<li>Dashboard Design: Prioritized user experience by grouping similar metrics together, using consistent color schemes, adding slicers for 
										dynamic filtering, and aligning visuals neatly to ensure a professional and clean look.</li>
									<li>Performance Optimization: Created efficient DAX measures (Total Sales, Total Orders) and optimized visual load times by minimizing heavy 
										queries and unnecessary visuals.</li>
								</b>
								</ol></p>
								<hr />
								<h4>Challenges Faced</h4>
								<p><ol><b>
									<li>Slicer Compatibility Across Visuals: Initially, slicers were not applying correctly to all visuals, causing inconsistent filtering.</li>
										<dd>Solution: Properly managed visual-level and page-level filters to ensure unified slicer behavior.</dd>
									<li>Balancing Visual Density and Simplicity: TWith multiple KPIs and visuals, there was a risk of making the dashboard look cluttered.</li>
									    <dd>Solution: Conducted stakeholder interviews to narrow focus to the most business-impacting KPIs.</dd>
									<li>Balancing Visual Appeal with Functionality: Ensuring the dashboards looked clean while being technically informative.</li>
									    <dd>Solution: Maintained minimalist design principles â€” used ample white space, grouped visuals logically, and emphasized key takeaways.</dd>
									</b>
									</ol></p>
								<hr />
								<h4>Impact & Outcome</h4>
								<p><ul>
									<b>
									<li>Delivered an intuitive, visually compelling dashboard that made it easier for executives and managers to monitor sales performance in real-time.</li>
									<li>Helped uncover key insights, such as identifying Technology as the highest-selling category and Consumer Segment contributing the largest share of sales.</li>
									<li>The dashboard became a single source of truth, reducing the need for manual Excel-based reporting.</li>
								</b>
								</ul></p>
