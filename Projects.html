								<h3><li>Sales & Customer Dashboard</h3></li>
							
								<p style="color: black;">In this project, I designed and developed two end-to-end interactive 
									Tableau dashboards—one focused on Sales Performance and the other on Customer Insights—to 
									support strategic decision-making for sales managers and executives. By cleaning and preparing 
									messy Excel datasets, conducting exploratory data analysis in Excel/SQL, and applying 
									visualization best practices, I created intuitive dashboards that visualize key KPIs like 
									total revenue, monthly trends, customer demographics, and churn rates. I implemented filters, 
									line graphs, bar charts, and heatmaps for dynamic exploration, while optimizing performance for 
									faster load times. Through stakeholder collaboration, I refined the scope to focus on impactful 
									metrics and ensured a balance between visual clarity and functionality. The dashboards replaced 
									manual Excel reports, saving time and improving transparency, while also enhancing my technical, 
									communication, and data storytelling skills.</p>

								<h3><li>Business Analysis & Process Management by Coursera Project Network</h3></li>
								<p style="color: black;">In this project, I applied core business analysis techniques to diagnose and improve inefficiencies 
									in a customer onboarding process, simulating a real-world consulting scenario. Using the Five Whys 
									method, I uncovered root causes such as unclear handoffs and departmental miscommunications, while 
									Lucidchart was used to design "As-Is" and "To-Be" process models that clarified workflows, roles, and 
									decision points. I addressed challenges like vague ownership, hidden inefficiencies, and resistance 
									to change by defining responsibilities, quantifying delays through Excel-based tracking, and presenting 
									visual models in stakeholder simulations. The project resulted in a detailed process improvement plan 
									that enhanced cross-functional communication and cut lead time by 30%, while also strengthening my skills 
									in process mapping, stakeholder analysis, and visual storytelling.</p>

								<h3><li>Expense Report by Loom Solar Pvt. Ltd. </h3></li>
                                <p style="color: black;">During my 3-month internship at Loom Solar Pvt. Ltd., I developed two interactive Power BI dashboards 
									to enhance financial transparency and support cost optimization. The Finance Report dashboard 
									integrated key financial statements—Profit and Loss, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow—while visualizing 
									net profit, revenue, and expense trends for monthly and quarterly comparisons. The Expense Report 
									dashboard tracked departmental spending across categories like marketing, salaries, and operations, 
									enabling filters by time and type for detailed analysis. By automating these reports, I reduced 
									dependency on manual Excel tracking and empowered leadership with real-time financial insights for 
									better budgeting and investment decisions, while strengthening my skills in Power BI, data modeling, 
									and financial reporting.</p>

								<h3><li>Sales Performance Dashboard Interactive Power BI Dashboards</h3></li>
								<p style="color: black;">In this project, I designed and developed a dynamic Power BI dashboard to analyze company-wide sales 
									performance across product categories, customer segments, and global regions. I visualized key KPIs 
									like Total Sales ($2.3M) and Total Orders (5K), incorporated slicers for year and category filtering, 
									and included visuals such as a top products table, sales by segment donut chart, and a regional sales 
									map. After cleaning and modeling the Excel dataset, I used DAX to create efficient measures and optimized 
									visuals for performance. I overcame challenges related to slicer compatibility and visual clutter by 
									refining filters and adopting minimalist design principles. The dashboard enabled executives to monitor 
									trends, uncover insights—like Technology being the top-selling category—and reduced reliance on manual 
									Excel reports. This project deepened my Power BI skills, reinforced the importance of clean data and 
									stakeholder-aligned design, and sharpened my ability to communicate insights through effective dashboard 
									storytelling.</p>
