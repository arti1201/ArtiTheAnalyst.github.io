							<h2>Data Analyst<br>
								Post-Graduate of Mathematics</h2>
						</header>
						<section class="wrapper style5">
							<div class="inner" style="color: black;">
							<p> I am a passionate and detail-oriented Data Analyst with a strong academic foundation in Mathematics and a growing track record in applying data-driven solutions to real-world business problems.</p>
							<p>After completing my Master’s and Bachelor’s degrees in Mathematics from the University of Delhi, I dove headfirst into the world of data — combining analytical thinking with technical tools like 
								Power BI, Excel, SQL, and Python to uncover insights, solve problems, and support better decision-making.</p>
							<p>My journey in data analytics began with hands-on certifications in Data Science (IIT Guwahati) and Google’s Data Analytics program, and deepened through practical work — including a 3-month internship 
								at Loom Solar Pvt. Ltd., where I created financial dashboards and investor-focused reports that visualized revenue, profit trends, and business health.</p>
							<p>Beyond that, I’ve built several personal projects including interactive dashboards, business process models, and text analytics assignments using tools like Tableau, Lucidchart, and R. I love 
								transforming messy, raw data into clean, impactful stories that help businesses move forward confidently.</p>
							<h4>What Drives Me:</h4>
							<p>I’m deeply fascinated by the power of data to tell stories, uncover hidden trends, and drive smart decisions. I believe good analytics is not just about numbers — it’s about understanding people, 
								processes, and impact.</p>
							<p>I bring to the table:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>A blend of technical skills and business thinking</li>
								<li>A self-motivated learning attitude</li>
								<li>A sincere, hardworking, and detail-oriented approach</li>
							</ul>
							<h4>My Vision:</h4>
							<p>To become a data-driven problem solver who not only analyzes the “what” but uncovers the “why” behind trends — helping businesses operate smarter, faster, and more efficiently. I’m looking for opportunities where I can work alongside inspiring teams and use my skills to make a meaningful impact.</p>
