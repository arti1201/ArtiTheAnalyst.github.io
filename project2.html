									<h3>Project Overview</h3>
								<p>This project focused on applying key business analysis tools and techniques to 
									diagnose, map, and improve inefficient business processes. The goal was to simulate 
									a real-world consulting experience — identifying process bottlenecks and delivering 
									strategic solutions through root cause analysis and visual modeling.</p>
								<hr />

								<h4>What I Did</h4>
								<p><b>Root Cause Analysis</b></p>
								<ul>
									<li>Applied the Five Whys technique to uncover the underlying causes of recurring process issues.</li>
									<li>Investigated a customer onboarding process with delays and miscommunications across departments.</li>
									<li>Identified critical inefficiencies in handoff procedures between sales and operations.</li>
								</ul>
								<p><b>Process Modeling</b></p>
								<ul>
									<li>Designed Lucidchart process maps to visualize existing workflows and proposed improvements.</li>
									<li>Created both "As-Is" and "To-Be" models, helping stakeholders understand gaps and proposed changes.</li>
									<li>Mapped decision points, data flow, and interdepartmental dependencies to clarify responsibility.</li>
								</ul>
                                <h4>Challenges Faced</h4>
								<p><ul>
									<li><b>Unclear Ownership:</b> The process involved multiple teams with vague handoffs, leading to finger-
										pointing and delays.</li>
                                        <dd>Solution: Clearly defined each team’s roles and responsibilities in the updated workflow model.</dd>
									<li><b>Hidden Inefficiencies:</b>Stakeholders were unaware of the small delays stacking up to major inefficiencies.</li>
									    <dd>Solution: Quantified the impact of each delay using simple Excel-based time tracking and demonstrated how streamlining would cut lead time by 30%.</dd>
									<li><b>Resistance to Change:</b> Some team members were skeptical of the changes due to unfamiliarity with modeling tools.</li>
									    <dd>Solution: Presented before-and-after process flows in Lucidchart during a simulated stakeholder meeting to demonstrate clarity and value.</dd>
								</ul></p>
								<h4>Impact & Outcome</h4>
								<ul>
									<li>Produced a comprehensive business process improvement plan backed by visual evidence and root cause logic.</li>
									<li>The visual models facilitated better cross-functional alignment and communication in simulated stakeholder reviews.</li>
									<li>Gained hands-on experience in business process optimization, stakeholder analysis, and professional documentation.</li>
								</ul>
								<h4>Takeaways</h4>
								<ul>
									<li>Strengthened my understanding of business analysis frameworks such as SIPOC, Five Whys, and process mapping.</li>
									<li>Learned how to convert stakeholder pain points into actionable solutions.</li>
									<li>Improved my ability to visually communicate complex ideas using professional tools like Lucidchart.</li>
								</ul>
